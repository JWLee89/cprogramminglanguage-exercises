# The C Programming Language 2nd Edition Exercises
This contains all my own personal solutions to the exercises to the <a href="http://amzn.to/2i2rck0">c programming language second edition<a/> exercises. Note however, that my solutions are not perfect, as I am just starting out on learning C. Hope this encourages and helps out anyone that comes across it!

If you want the official solutions to all the exercises, I recommend checking out [the solutions here](http://amzn.to/2fGXlg0).

This github repository serves as a way to keep myself accountable in going through all the exercises in the book step by step. I highly recommend developers who want to start learning C to not cut corners and start from the ground up.
